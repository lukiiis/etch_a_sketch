# Sketchpad

A simple sketchpad app built in JavaScript.

## Description

This web app is a sketchpad, on which you can draw whatever you want. After choosing a color, you can start drawing by pressing left mouse button on the grid. There are two types of pencils: single-colored one and rainbow one, which draws colorful lines. Also, there is a rubber that can erase already colored spots on a sketchpad and a button that clears whole sketchpad. The sketchpad's grid size can range from 16x16 to 64x64.
